- All data comes from the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey.
- On the explore page, this data is filtered for outliers, minimum sample size, and displayed graphically.
- The prediction page utilizes a machine learning model to apply a decision tree regression to the survey data.
- The model considers important factors such as Country of Employment, Education Level, and Years of Professional Experience.
- The machine learning model is then used to predict the expected salary based upon the supplied parameters.
